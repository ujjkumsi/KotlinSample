# KotlinSample

This project is my walkthrough to understand new development practice in android environment using Kotlin.
My focus will be create a project with Rx + Dagger + Room + Litho + MVP + Branch + DataBinding + Retro

Master branch is skeleton containing Rx + Dagger

Other branches naming convention includes feature that are used to develop them.

Lets see how much far we can go :)
